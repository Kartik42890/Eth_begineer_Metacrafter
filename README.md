# Coin Contract
This contract is designed to handle the creation and management of a coin. It includes functionality to mint new coins, burn existing coins, and keep track of balances for different addresses.

Public Variables
The contract includes the following public variables to store details about the coin:

tokenName (string): Represents the name of the token.
tokenAbbreviation (string): Represents the abbreviation or symbol of the token.
totalSupply (uint): Represents the total supply of the token.
Mapping of Addresses to Balances
The contract maintains a mapping of addresses to balances. This allows tracking the token balance of each address. The mapping follows the structure: mapping(address => uint) balances. The key is the address, and the value is the balance associated with that address.

Mint Function
The mint function is used to create new tokens. It takes two parameters: an address and a value. The function increases the total supply of the token by the specified value and adds that amount to the balance of the provided address. The function signature is as follows:

solidity
Copy code
function mint(address _address, uint _value) public
Burn Function
The burn function allows the destruction of tokens. It also takes two parameters: an address and a value. This function reduces the total supply of the token by the specified value and deducts that amount from the balance of the given address. The function signature is as follows:

solidity
Copy code
function burn(address _address, uint _value) public
To ensure proper execution, the burn function includes conditionals to verify that the balance of the provided address is greater than or equal to the value being burned. If the condition is not met, the function will revert and no tokens will be burned.

Usage
To utilize this contract, you can follow these steps:

Deploy the contract to your preferred blockchain network.
Set the initial values for tokenName, tokenAbbreviation, and totalSupply.
Use the mint function to create new tokens by specifying an address and the amount to be minted.
Use the burn function to destroy tokens by specifying an address and the amount to be burned. Ensure the address has a sufficient balance.
It is important to handle access control and permissions appropriately to prevent unauthorized minting or burning of tokens.
